The bare minimum required for this program to function is the latest version of Python, followed by 
OpenCV and MegaPi. OpenCV allows us to control the camera we'll need to take snapshots of the garden,
and MegaPi is what we need to use the controller on the Makeblock Ultimate 2.0 robot.

Python's latest version can be found and installed on their website.

Assuming Python's package installer Pip is installed, OpenCV and MegaPi can be installed natively on your device's terminal. 
To check if Pip is installed, type "pip --version" in your command line.
If pip is not installed, enter these commands to install:
1. curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
2. python get-pip.py

Then enter the following commands to install OpenCV and Megapi:
"pip install opencv"
"pip install megapi"
